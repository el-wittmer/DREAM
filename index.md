## About Me

Hi! I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current iCAN student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort). I come to Computer Science by way of Linguistics, where I discovered a love of working with data and experimental design. I'm interested in a wide range of topics, but currently I'm focusing on graph theory, data visualization, and working with natural language processing. 

## About My Advisor

George Chacko is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at UIUC. You can find his website <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge">here.</a>

## About My Project

My project is an interdisciplinary project consisting of critical evaluation of Scientometrics literature, utilizing methods to interrogate large graphs, and scientific discovery. A core component is extending the state of the art in clustering methods to detect research communities that assemble around related scientific questions. Of particular interest will be qualitatively evaluating nodes to determine key topics in research communities. The spectrum of methods used range across data mining, curation, and clustering. Any results generated are evaluated using both theoretical and qualitative criteria. I am leveraging prior work and tacit knowledge from the Chacko-Warnow collaboration in this area that combines discovery-driven interests with graph-theoretical expertise, e.g. Wedell et al (2022) https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00184.
