## About Me
Hi there! I'm Elaina, and I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May of 2023. My undergraduate degree was in Linguistics, which I completed at Reed College in 2019. Through that experience, I developed a love of working with unscructured data and being able to tell powerful stories through the power of computing. This passion brought me to the [iCAN](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) program at UIUC, a bridge program designed to broaden access to computing to include those from underrepresented backgrounds. All work presented here has been completed within the past two years during my time in iCAN or in the Master's program at UIUC.

## DREAM Fellowship
While in the iCAN program, I was fortunate to be a [DREAM](https://tech.mines.edu/dream/) Fellow and conduct research on the nature of scientific impact with [Dr. George Chacko](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge). I was able to devote 400 hours of work on an independent project of my choice through the support of the DREAM program. More information about this project, including my project blog, can be found [here](dream.md). 

## Completed Projects
*All project titles link to more information about the project, such as a project report, presentation, or website.*
### Data & Information Systems
- **[Impact Assessment of a Single Study](dream.md)**
    - An evaluation of the metrics used to quantify the impact of a single scientific paper. See also: [DREAM Fellowship](#dream-fellowship).
    - *This work was extended by students in the [CS STARS program at UIUC, Fall 2022 cohort](https://cs.illinois.edu/broadening-participation-computing/programs/csambassadors/participants).*


- **[Spawning Connections: The Early Days of Paul (1963)](http://el-wittmer.github.io/Paul_1963)**
    - A spin-off project from my Impact Assessment project. I use the JavaScript D3 library to model the citation network of an influential paper in Coronary Heart Disease over its first three years of publication. 

- **[Adaptive Recipe Book for Food Allergies](https://github.com/el-wittmer/cs411-database-project)** *(Private Repo)*
    - A Django project which allows the user to search, delete, create, and edit recipes while keeping track of allergens within said recipes. A cool feature of this project is that newly added allergy information is retroactively applied to existing dataset entries, creating a richer dataset over time. 

### Artificial Intelligence
- **[Design Recommendations for Human-AI Interaction in Image Generation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pcPoFqOXO5WyyaxGif4qyJ72yneCM5hV/view?usp=drive_link)**
    - This experimental project evaluates prompt design choices leading to successful AI image generation. The results suggest UI/UX changes to both communicate the limitations of AI to end users while guiding them towards crafting more successful prompts.

- **[Can ChatGPT Engineer Software?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1v-4FqAa6j1NZYFmaZd7XFShPgtZ8l8/view?usp=drive_link)**
    - This project evaluates ChatGPT performance on code generation, unit testing, bug detection, and more in both Python and Java. 

### Systems
- **[Evaluation of Security Practices in Interdomain Routing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tCR5wKIDQftQKBXn3n9eG4IzN6lhFY4r/view?usp=drive_link)**
    - This report evaluates security concerns for common protocols used in Internet routing, what solutions are currently available, and cutting edge technologies which might replace current practices.
