## About Me
Hi there! I'm Elaina, and I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May of 2023. My undergraduate degree was in Linguistics, which I completed at Reed College in 2019. Through that experience, I developed a love of working with unscructured data and being able to tell powerful stories through the power of computing. This passion brought me to the [iCAN](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) program at UIUC, a bridge program designed to broaden access to computing to include those from underrepresented backgrounds. While in the iCAN program, I was fortunate to be a [DREAM](https://tech.mines.edu/dream/) Fellow and conduct research on the nature of scientific impact with [Dr. George Chacko](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge).
