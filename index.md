## About Me
Hi there! I'm Elaina, and I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May of 2023. My undergraduate degree was in Linguistics, which I completed at Reed College in 2019. Through that experience, I developed a love of working with unscructured data and being able to tell powerful stories through the power of computing. This passion brought me to the [iCAN](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) program at UIUC, a bridge program designed to broaden access to computing to include those from underrepresented backgrounds. 

## DREAM Fellowship
While in the iCAN program, I was fortunate to be a [DREAM](https://tech.mines.edu/dream/) Fellow and conduct research on the nature of scientific impact with [Dr. George Chacko](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge). I was able to devote 400 hours of work on an independent project of my choice through the support of the DREAM program, the details of which can be found [here](dream.md).

## Completed Projects
### Data & Information Systems
- **[Impact Assessment of a Single Study](dream.md)**
    - An evaluation of the metrics used to quantify the impact of a single scientific paper. 
    - *This work was extended by students in the [CS STARS program at UIUC, Fall 2022 cohort](https://cs.illinois.edu/broadening-participation-computing/programs/csambassadors/participants).*


- **[Spawning Connections: The Early Days of Paul 1963](http://el-wittmer.github.io/Paul_1963)**
    - A spin-off project from my Impact Assessment project, I use the JavaScript D3 library to model the citation network of an influential paper in Coronary Heart Disease over its first three years of publication. 

### Artificial Intelligence
- **Design Recommendations for Human-AI Interaction in Image Generation**
    - This is experimental project evaluating prompt design choices leading to successful AI image generation. The results of this mixed methods study show that the best prompts in image generation have a small, loosely defined scope. It is also helpful to take an interative approach, starting with a small idea and adding more detail to the prompt after viewing the results.

- **Can ChatGPT Engineer Software?**
    - This project evaluates ChatGPT performance on code generation, unit testing, bug detection, and more in two programming languages: Python and Java.

### Systems
- **Evaluation of Security Practices in Interdomain Routing**
    - This report evaluates security concerns for common protocols used in Internet routing, what solutions are currently available, and cutting edge technologies that might replace current practices.
