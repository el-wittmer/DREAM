## About Me

Hi! I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current iCAN student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort). I got my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2019, through which I discovered a love of data wrangling and experimental design. My current research interests include graph theory, data visualization, and dabbling with natural language processing.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge">George Chacko</a> is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at UIUC and Executive Director of Research Analytics at the Grainger College of Engineering. His research interests span novelty in science, research impact, knowledge diffusion, and the structure of research communities. More generally, research in scientometrics.

## About My Project

My project is composed of a) critical evalutation of relevant literature in Scientometrics, b) utilizing methods to interrogate large citation graphs, and c) fostering scientific discovery and curiosity. Clustering methods can be used to identify research communities formed around a particular research question. A key part of this project will be to generate keywords to describe the unifying topic(s) for each cluster in a citation graph. While this task can be performed manually, an accurate, automated process would drastically reduce the amount of time required to complete it.
