## About Me

I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current iCAN student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort). I got my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2019, through which I discovered a love of data wrangling and experimental design. My current research interests include graph theory, data visualization, and dabbling with natural language processing.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge">George Chacko</a> is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at UIUC and Executive Director of Research Analytics at the Grainger College of Engineering. His research interests span novelty in science, research impact, knowledge diffusion, and the structure of research communities. More generally, his research involves scientometrics.

## About My Project

[Bu et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00109) propose four new metrics for measuring the impact of a research article: breadth, depth, dependence, and independence. These metrics provide more information about the impact of a given article than a standard citation count allows, as two papers can have the same number of citations but differing levels of breadth/depth or dependence/independence.

However, Bu et al. apply their methods to i) 36.2 million publications extracted from Web of Science and ii) 14,464 publications determined, through a clustering approach, to be related to scientometrics. In contrast, this project will apply the metrics from Bu et al. to a much more focused data set -- citation data pertaining to histone research written in English and published between 1980 and 1990. 

Through using a more focused data set and introducing a time dimension, these metrics can inform how histone research has changed over the decade. An increasing amount of dependence might indicate the existence of a foundation of research that new papers are building on, while a stable or increasing level of independence may indicate that research in this area is fragmented. Similarly, increasing levels of depth would suggest close-knit communities were developing within histone research, while high levels of breadth would indicate that histone research was mostly being cited by external communities.
