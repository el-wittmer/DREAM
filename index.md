## About Me
Hi there! I'm Elaina, and I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May of 2023. My undergraduate degree was in Linguistics, which I completed at Reed College in 2019. Through that experience, I developed a love of working with unscructured data and being able to tell powerful stories through the power of computing. This passion brought me to the [iCAN](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) program at UIUC, a bridge program designed to broaden access to computing to include those from underrepresented backgrounds. 

## DREAM Fellowship
While in the iCAN program, I was fortunate to be a [DREAM](https://tech.mines.edu/dream/) Fellow and conduct research on the nature of scientific impact with [Dr. George Chacko](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge). I was able to devote 400 hours of work on an independent project of my choice through the support of the DREAM program, the details of which can be found [here](dream.md).

## Current Interests

## Completed Projects
### Data Science
- [Impact Assessment of a Single Study](dream.md)
    - An analysis of a single scientific paper and an evaluation of the metrics used to quantify its impact. 

### Artificial Intelligence
- *Design Recommendations for Human-AI Interaction in Image Generation*
    - This is experimental project evaluating prompt design choices leading to successful AI image generation. The results of this mixed methods study show that the best prompts in image generation have a small, loosely defined scope. It is also helpful to take an interative approach, starting with a small idea and adding more detail to the prompt after viewing the results.

- *Can ChatGPT develop software?*
    - This project evaluates ChatGPT performance on code generation, unit testing, bug detection, and more in two programming languages: Python and Java.

### Systems
- Evaluation of Security Practices in Interdomain Routing
    - This report evaluates security concerns for common protocols used in Internet routing, what solutions are currently available, and cutting edge technologies that might replace current practices.
