## About Me

I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current iCAN student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort). I got my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2019, through which I discovered a love of data wrangling and experimental design. My current research interests include graph theory, data visualization, and dabbling with natural language processing.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge">George Chacko</a> is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at UIUC and Executive Director of Research Analytics at the Grainger College of Engineering. His research interests span novelty in science, research impact, knowledge diffusion, and the structure of research communities. More generally, research in scientometrics.

## About My Project

[Bu et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00109) propose four new metrics for measuring the impact of a research article: breadth, depth, dependence, and independence. These metrics provide more information about the impact of a given article than a standard citation count allows, as two papers can have the same number of citations but differing levels of breadth/depth or dependence/independence. [Read more about metrics](https://el-wittmer.github.io/week6/)

However, Bu et al. apply their methods to i) 36.2 million publications extracted from Web of Science and ii) 14,464 publications determined to be related to scientometrics specifically.
