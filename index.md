## About Me

Hi! I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current iCAN student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort). I got my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2019, through which I discovered a love of data wrangling and experimental design. My current research interests include graph theory, data visualization, and dabbling with natural language processing.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge">Dr. George Chacko</a> is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at UIUC. His research falls under the Data and Information Sciences umbrella within Computer Science and more specifically revolves around Scientometrics (qualitative evaluation of scientific research). His prior work includes the <a href="https://netesolutions.github.io/ernie_homepage/">ERNIE project</a> as well as <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/3/1/289/109629/Center-periphery-structure-in-research-communities">evaluating the structure of research communities through citation data</a>.

## About My Project

My project consists of critical evalutation of relevant scientific literature and using data mining and clustering techniques to examine large-scale citation graph data. In part, I am working on summarizing citation clusters at scale using NLP techniques to determine the topics that define a given cluster. Current techniques are not scalable and require manual evaluation of paper titles and/or abstracts to extract information about the citations included in any given cluster. Being able to summarize the key topics in a cluster would allow for further insight into the structure of a scientific community after it has been identified.
