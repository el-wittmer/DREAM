## About Me

Hi! I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current iCAN student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort). I got my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2019, through which I discovered a love of data wrangling and experimental design. My current research interests include graph theory, data visualization, and dabbling with natural language processing.
