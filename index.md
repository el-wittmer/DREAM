## About Me

I'm Elaina â€” I'm a current [iCAN student](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2021-2022 cohort) and a [DREAM fellow](https://tech.mines.edu/dream/). I got my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2019, where I discovered a love of data wrangling and experimental design. I'm interested in topics under the data science umbrella, but my current research interests include graph theory, data visualization, and dabbling with natural language processing. 

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge">George Chacko</a> is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at UIUC and Executive Director of Research Analytics at the Grainger College of Engineering. His research interests span novelty in science, research impact, knowledge diffusion, and the structure of research communities. More generally, his research involves scientometrics.

## About My Project

Recent studies have focused on assessing the impact of publications using citation data. This study addresses concepts of "breadth" and "depth" and uses recently introduced metrics to quantitatively assess the breadth and depth of a single study, Paul et al. (1963). The results of these measurements are compared against previous qualitative assessments of the network of citations to Paul et al. (1963). Findings show that Paul et al. (1963) can be considered "broad" at the onset of publication, but deepens over the course of its lifespan, contrasting previous qualitative interpretations. It is likely that the breadth and depth metrics used in this study are used to distinguish publications cited for methodology from those cited for their discoveries. As such, I suggest that breadth and depth be weighted differently for methods papers and research articles to better distinguish differences in citation patterns within these two categories.
