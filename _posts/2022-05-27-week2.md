<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

This week I worked on more PostgreSQL, creating csv files in Linux, and learning more about the habanero Python library. We also discussed a project idea that will involve summarizing batches of papers using frequently-used title words. 

<h2>Journal Articles</h2>

Boyack, K. W., & Klavans, R. (2010). Co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and direct citation: Which citation approach represents the research front most accurately? *Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology*, *61*(12), 2389–2404. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.21419

Klavans, R., & Boyack, K. W. (2016). Which Type of Citation Analysis Generates the Most Accurate Taxonomy of Scientific and Technical Knowledge? *Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology*, *68*(4), 984–998. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23734

<h2>Things I made</h2>
In collaboration with Prof. Chacko, I developed a script using the habanero Python library that will take a list of dois and return a csv file containing both the doi searched and the title of the paper. Because the Crossref module in habanero will only allow you to search so many dois at one time, doi searches need to be done in batches. This script will read a csv file containing dois, run doi searches in batches of a desired increment, and return the total results as a csv file.
