## Learning Objectives

- More data wrangling, removing reciprocal citations and self-citations from a data set
    - Reciprocal citations occur when two papers cite each other. This is very difficult to do without collusion. In my data, I've observed this happening when an author is working on multiple papers at the same time, and so cites their other papers ahead of publishing. Unfortunately, this creates a cycle in the directed graph, which shouldn't occur and the Leiden algorithm will count these instances as duplicates and reject the input network. 
    - One solution is to sort the data such that if A -> B and B -> A are both in the network, after sorting there will be two instances of A -> B, at which point removing duplicates is easy. The problem with this solution is that detecting duplicates in advance is a challenge, so this method currently requires sorting the entire network, after which this graph could no longer in good faith be considered a directed graph. If paper D cites paper C, after sorting, the data will show paper C cites paper D, which is not true. 
    - I'm still working on fixing this issue, but am working on troubleshooting in the code mentioned in the next bullet point by using the undirected network. 
- Working with code developed to calculate Bu et al.'s metrics, developed by Franklin Moy at UIUC
    - I haven't implemented code written by others before so this is a challenge in reading documentation, understanding the parameters, and interpreting error messages as they arise. Franklin's pipeline runs in three stages and my files are being rejected at the second stage. I'm currently in the process of figuring out why.

## Other

### UIUC Seminar

This week's UIUC Research seminar was focused on academic writing and publishing, with Professors Reyhaneh Jabbarvand, Charith Mendis, and Tandy Warnow as speakers. Some things discussed included what the structure of a journal article looks like, different responses you may receive when you begin publishing (e.g. "Accepted with minor revisions"), and some of the motivations one might have for publishing. One thing that stuck out to me was how important it is to write throughout the research process and keep notes on what you've done, why you did it, and what you found out. While it's hard to do in the moment, it's easy to look back and miss details when relying purely on your own memory. 

## Struggles

This week I've been struggling with developing a research question that I'm happy with. I know the type of project and data I want to work with, but I'm just not sure what I want to do with it, what I can do with it, and whether there's any overlap between the two.
