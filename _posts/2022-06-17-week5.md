<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Finish histone data co-citation frequency counts and graphs</li>
  <li>Read and present Leng (2021)</li>
  <li>Start on creating a citation network using the Leiden algorithm</li>
</ul>
<h2>Journal Articles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Leng, R. I. (2021). Diversity in citations to a single study: A citation context network analysis of how evidence from a prospective cohort study was cited. Quantitative Science Studies, 2(4), 1216â€“1245. https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00154</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Leng examines citations attributed to Paul et al. (1963), a study which examined variables correlated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Notably, Paul et al. found no correlation between diet and CHD at a time when the idea that consuming high levels of dietary fat was a contributing factor in developing CHD. </li>

<li>Paul et al. is considered a highly cited paper with 673 citations as of 2020 and 446 citations within 20 years of publication. However, Leng finds that people citing Paul et al. rarely did so because of this negative result. More commonly, a research community appeared to select a particular finding from this study that suppored their own claims. </li>

<li>As an example, Paul et al. found no correlation between diet and CHD, but *did* find a correlation between high serum cholesterol and CHD. Those who believed that poor diet caused high serum cholesterol, which in turn caused CHD, would cite only the cholesterol findings and omit the dietary findings. </li>

<li>The results of Paul et al. were utilized by a broad range of research communities in one form or another (breadth), but the findings were not foundational or crucial to any one community (depth).</li>
