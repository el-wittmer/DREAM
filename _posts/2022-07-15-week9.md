## Objectives
- Data Wrangling and Lo-Fi visualizations
  - Cluster graph (not sure if I'll use) 
  - Breadth/depth raw count stacked bar chart
- Data issues: missing dois and matching to Open Citations
  - I discovered that much of the data used in Leng (2022) are missing digital object identifiers (DOIs). Dois are used to assign publications a unique code which can be used to identify that publication on the web. However, the publications that make up the data I'm working with were published in the 1960s-1970s and weren't highly influential, as such, these documents weren't assigned DOIs retroactively. All of these articles have Web of Science IDs, and most of them are on Scopus, but I'm running into an issue of how to determine how to verify the validity of my data.
