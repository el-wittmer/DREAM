## Objectives

This week's objectives were to work on refining some of my figures and work on writing my final report. 

 <img src="/images/Citation_count.png" width="400" height="300" alt="The number of citations Paul et al. (1963) earned each year over the first twenty years of publication. The paper received the maximum number of citation per year in 1967, with peaks and valleys following over time. Surprisingly, Paul et al. (1963) continued to earn citations even 15 to 20 years after publication. Leng (2022) attributes this to a new interest in a potential correlation between alcohol consumption and CHD that began in the mid-to-late 70's.">
 
<img src="/images/BD_ratio.png" width="400" height="300" alt="The ratio of citing papers classified as 'broad' (blue) vs. those classified as 'deep' (orange) for Paul et al. (1963). The grey line indicates a ratio of 0.5, the point at which Paul et al. (1963) has equal breadth and depth. This point occurs around 1966, after which the ratio of depth increases over time while the ratio of breadth decreases. In the first year of publication, there are more 'broad' nodes than deep ones (0.75 to 0.25). After three years, there's nearly an even split (0.46 to 0.53), but the percentage of 'deep' nodes continues to grow while the percentage of 'broad' ones decreases. ">

I've also been working on visualizations using data from this project using the JavaScript library D3. This project is still ongoing, but when finished, it will be hosted <a href="https://el-wittmer.github.io/Paul_1963/">here</a>.
