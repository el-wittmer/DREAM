<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
Working with creating a co-citation graph using the histone data generated in previous weeks. Writing scripts to generate keyword summaries of graph clusters. 

<h2>Journal Articles</h2>

Pimple (2002) asks three questions of any research project: "Is it true? Is it fair? Is it wise?" Truth here refers primarily to falsified data that do not truely reflect reality. Fairness relates to relationships between the researchers and others. In human-subject experiments, it can refer to the relationship between the researchers and participants in experiments. It can also refer to plagiarism: stealing work from others is unfair to the original researcher. Finally, wisdom has more to do with the impact of the research. If the research being done has a negative effect on the world, the researcher has a moral obligation to not conduct said research. 

Pimple then provides a framework for expanding upon these questions in detail, which can be used by newcomers and seasoned researchers alike. Given that research is a social endeavor, each scientist has an obligation to maintain the integrity of the research record and be a good community member.

Expanding on Pimple (2002), Zigmond & Fischer (2002) categorize breaches in research conduct as "high crimes and misdemeanors." High crimes include falsification and fabrication of data as well as plagiarism and are generally recognized as inappropriate conduct. Misdemeanors, on the other hand, are much trickier and include not disclosing funding sources, intentionally hindering replication efforts, and instances of "honorary authorship." Another example of a misdemeanor might be hiding information behind unclear and/or bloated writing that can easily be misinterpreted. A good community member does not seek to mislead their audience and aims to be clear in their writing and transparent about their methods.

<h2>Things I made</h2>

In progress: a script that generates co-citation counts when given a input set of citation data. 
In progress: a script that when given a set of dois, returns a set of keywords reflecting common topics found within those papers. 

<h2>Other</h2>
This week I attended my first UIUC Summer REU seminar, which was titled "How to do Research: Part I." These seminars are hosted in-person every Wednesday, but they are broadcast over Zoom for those working remotely (including myself). Wednesday's seminar seemed to serve as a Q&A platform more than anything where students completing research at UIUC over the summer could ask questions to a panel of faculty members. These week the panel was hosted by Camille Cobb, Matus Telgarsky, and Tianyin Xu. Many of the questions centered around best practices for approaching professors you'd like to work on research with, which I found personally confusing as those at the seminar already have faculty mentors as part of the REU process. Perhaps they're looking ahead for grad school opportunities? 

The most important thing I took away from the panel, brought up by Tianyin Xu, was that persistance is far more important than genius when it comes to research (though this is applicable to life in general). He brought up how he failed at his first attempt in pursuing a PhD (which I also did), but how he tried again because he knew what he wanted and the types of questions he wanted to pursue. I think it's helpful to be reminded of the "why" every once in a while.
